// Trigger - The `\"ON_HOVER\"` and `\"ON_PRESS\"` trigger types revert the navigation when the trigger is finished (the result is temporary). `\"MOUSE_ENTER\"`, `\"MOUSE_LEAVE\"`, `\"MOUSE_UP\"` and `\"MOUSE_DOWN\"` are permanent, one-way navigation. The `delay` parameter requires the trigger to be held for a certain duration of time before the action occurs. Both `timeout` and `delay` values are in milliseconds. The `\"ON_MEDIA_HIT\"` and `\"ON_MEDIA_END\"` trigger types can only trigger from a video. They fire when a video reaches a certain time or ends. The `timestamp` value is in seconds.
type Trigger struct {
	AfterTimeoutTrigger *AfterTimeoutTrigger

	TriggerOneOf1       *TriggerOneOf1
